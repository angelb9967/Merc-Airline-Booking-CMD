# ‚úàÔ∏è MERC: Console-Based Airline Booking System

## ‚ú® Project Overview

MERC is a console-based airline booking system developed in C++. üöÄüé´ 

It serves as a project demonstrating fundamental programming concepts such as conditionals (switches), loops, and effective user input handling within a command-line environment. The system features a custom text-based interface, enhanced with ASCII art to provide an engaging and simulated functional booking experience. 

This project was developed early in my programming journey, focusing primarily on `switch` statements and `loops`.

## üåü Key Features

Explore the core functionalities of MERC:

*   **Flight Options Display:** Presents users with a selection of pre-defined flight options.
*   **Booking Process:** Guides users through a step-by-step booking process, including seat selection and passenger details.
*   **User Input Handling:** Implements robust mechanisms for receiving and validating user input.
*   **Text-Based UI with ASCII Art:** Provides a custom and interactive user interface entirely within the console, utilizing ASCII visuals for an enhanced experience.
*   **Conditional Logic (Switches) & Loops:** Demonstrates essential programming constructs for flow control and repetitive tasks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Utilized

MERC is constructed upon the following core technologies:

*   **C++:** The primary programming language used for developing the entire console-based application logic.
*   **Standard C++ Libraries:** Utilizes standard libraries for input/output operations, string manipulation, and other core functionalities.
*   **`conio.h` and `windows.h`:** Employed for console-specific functions, especially for handling input and output characteristics on Windows systems.

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions detail the process of setting up and running the MERC Console-Based Airline Booking System on a local development environment.

### üìã Prerequisites

*   A C++ Compiler (e.g., g++ for GCC, Clang, or Visual C++)
*   A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) compatible with C++ (e.g., VS Code, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio)

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Merc-Airline-Booking-CMD.git
    ```
2.  **Open Project in Your IDE:**
    *   Launch your preferred C++ IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio).
    *   Open the `CPG PROJECT.cpp` file or create a new project and add this file to it.
    *   Ensure your IDE is configured to compile C++ projects.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

To run the MERC application after opening it in your IDE:

1.  **Compile and Run:**
    *   Use your IDE's built-in functionality to compile and run the program. This is typically done by pressing `F9`, `F11`, or a similar "Run" button/menu option within the IDE.

2.  **Follow On-Screen Prompts:**
    The system will guide you through the airline booking process using text-based prompts in the console window that appears. Enter your choices and information as requested to navigate through flight options, selections, and booking confirmations.

**Note:**
This program was originally developed for Windows 7 using `conio.h` and `windows.h`.
It runs on Windows 10 and 11, but console colors and layout may appear slightly different due to modern console behavior.
